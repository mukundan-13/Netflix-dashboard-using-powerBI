I have created a interactive dashboard using powerBI by analyzing and cleaning the Netflix sample dataset. I have created many cards and stats that help others to easily identify and find out the necessary keys. 
The cards include:
▪️Total count of generes
▪️Total rating
▪️Available generes
▪️Sum of duration in minutes
▪️Movies/Web series
▪️Director

Additionally I have also added a global map, which showcase clearly about the userbase and people watching Netflix based on above mentioned parameters. 

By this stats, they could identify where the usage is high and making profit and at which location the usage is low and change the contents based on their needs. 

Though it is a sample dataset, I have analyzed clearly and cleaned the errors and created this interactive dashboard
